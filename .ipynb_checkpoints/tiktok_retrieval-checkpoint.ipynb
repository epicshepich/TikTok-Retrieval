    "    - We have set it up such that queries will match with a term regardless of which feature it came from, so field attributions will only have an impact on a document term's IDF. We expect that this should help mitigate the negative impact of off-topic comment text, which tends to be more verbose than the basic information.\n",

    "The test queries were constructed to this end, and they thus only have a single relevant retrieval target. Because we are only dealing with a single relevant document for each query, the metric we will use to evaluate performance is the average rank of the target in the similarity-ranked list. In the best case, this metric will be close to 1. If the retrieval system were to rank documents at random, we would expect the metric to be around ~731 (the midpoint of the list).

    "Interestingly, it appears that comments have the strongest impact on indexing time; enriching the basic information with comments alone results in a >5x increase in the time it takes to index the corpus, nearly ~2.5x more than if we enrich with both speech recognition and optical character recognition. This trend is certainly also present in average query time, but the differences are less pronounced. The comments had better be pretty useful for improving search, then, or else they're just not worth it. We will probably see a similar trend in index storage and query time as wee see here. \n",
