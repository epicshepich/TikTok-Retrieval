It was especially fun to share with my 3 year old daughter. The print is available on my website, www.DavidMBird.com Monarchs are in decline and are now on a bunch of endangered lists. I was surprised to learn that the caterpillars really only need milkweed to survive. I always thought of milkweed as just a weed to be pulled, but now I realize how magical this plant is, and so vital to the monarchs. So I’ll be planting milkweed next year.
