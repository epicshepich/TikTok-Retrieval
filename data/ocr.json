Alot of content from the\n\u2018Tanga are beyond the existing manpower to work with Animators who\n\u2018an draw and perform the character acting vl too rare. Even if you\nay them alot of money, there is a imit on human physical stength and\ntherefore amount of work that can be digested by a man has a constraint\n10, $0 I's not that we dort want to hand draw it i's about Using the\nProvided resources effienly and rationally by choosing which content\nto use wth 30 or 2D. Orawing requires physical strength. The standard\nnit for animation is know as cut, and there may only be one frame fora\nut, but there may also be hundreds frames fora cut. No matter how fast\nperson can ra its impossibleto draw hundreds of frames ina short\ntime, Yet, this can be done efficiently by using 3D, and then rendered it\nwith 20 drawings or use digital program to comect the 3D designs. This\n\u2018way you can have both efficiency and quality done, So this isa very\n\u2018reasonable approach in curtent industry.\n\nHe also added some more thoughts int it that saddened me after learning\nthe true reality ofthe whole situation:\n\n\u2018Many people ask for traditional 2D drawings, but unfortunately there are\newer and fewer mature (skilled) 20 animators in current industry. The\ndesire of 1 want todo it this way\u2019 and actually able to doit well in real\nlife is diferent... fact itis very dificult under current conditions in this\nindustry. If only every animation show has enough talents to participate\n\nits production, there wouldrit be a problem forthe options of 2D or 30\n\u2018cause you have enough resources and support.\n\n\u2018The current status ofthis industry is: low pay and very few would\n\u2018wanna work for it. Even if a studio only managed to come out with ONE\nhigh-quality produc, it is already a bless. This isthe harsh reality we face\nand if any of you is realy interested with this work and have ideas for\nthe animation production, we welcome your participations, join us and\n\u2018Support us to perfect the work.\n\n",
