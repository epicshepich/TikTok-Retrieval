Up at 7 a.m. to account for the time difference and walked into the conference room with my eyes totally focused on their computer I'd actually walked most of the way in before I realized there was a group of people around the conference table having a ridiculously early morning meeting the guy at the end of the table apparently thinking I'd showed up for the meeting and that I was heading towards him handed me a paper that said agenda and said he was so glad a graduate student had shown up then launched into the most incomprehensible talk about electrodes and chemistry meanwhile I know my girlfriend is sitting half way around the world we're going to Funtime Skype and I'm blowing her off and I'm feeling desperate but everything I knew about us culture was only based on movies so I have no idea if I can just apologize and leave want I'm miserably sat down for the incomprehensible meeting rehearsing all the excuses I can give my girlfriend when we talk later I was barely paying attention eventually questions were directed at me and I confess that I'm a new grad student and I don't know much about the equipment they're talking about everyone excitedly tells me all about it and I still don't totally understand what they mean except I'm starting to get that they're going on a research expedition to Antarctica and they're building a piece of equipment to bring with them by the end of the meeting on time part of the project 6 months later I am in Antarctica helping to operate this equipment I appeared briefly in the background of a Discovery Channel documentary only black guy within hundreds of miles so easy to spot I have Elite transferred to this other lab in this other field for my fully paid for PhD I'm considered a real go-getter mainly based on my arrival in early morning meeting no one else wanted to attend new major Newfield New Life because I was too awkward to admit I have just been in the room to Funtime Skype with my girlfriend",
